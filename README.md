# Shortly URL shortening API Challenge

This project is a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page, integrate with the [rel.ink](https://rel.ink) API and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser (local storage)
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
